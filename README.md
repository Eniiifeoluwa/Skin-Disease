## Disease Classes and Recommendations

Below are the 22 skin diseases this model can detect, along with actionable advice for each:

- **Acne**: Maintain a consistent skincare routine, avoid heavy makeup, and consider salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Consult a dermatologist for persistent acne.
- **Actinic Keratosis**: Limit sun exposure, use SPF 30+ sunscreen daily, and have regular skin checks due to cancer risk.
- **Benign Tumors**: Usually harmless. Monitor for changes and seek medical advice if they grow or change color.
- **Bullous**: Do not pop blisters. Keep them clean and consult a doctor. Autoimmune types need urgent care.
- **Candidiasis**: Keep skin dry and clean. Use antifungal creams and avoid tight clothing. Maintain good hygiene.
- **Drug Eruption**: Stop suspected medication and see a doctor immediately. Keep track of new prescriptions.
- **Eczema**: Moisturize regularly, avoid irritants like wool or scented products, and use topical steroids if prescribed.
- **Infestations/Bites**: Use insect repellents, clean bites with antiseptic, and treat infestations with medicated creams.
- **Lichen**: Manage with prescribed corticosteroids. Avoid scratching and reduce stress.
- **Lupus**: Avoid sunlight and use protective clothing. See a rheumatologist for systemic symptoms.
- **Moles**: Track any ABCDE changes (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolving). Visit a dermatologist if suspicious.
- **Psoriasis**: Keep skin moist, avoid triggers like stress, and follow prescribed treatments including phototherapy.
- **Rosacea**: Identify and avoid triggers (spicy food, alcohol, sunlight). Use gentle skincare and prescribed treatments.
- **Seborrheic Keratoses**: Benign but can be removed if irritated. Monitor for changes and rule out malignancy.
- **Skin Cancer**: Early detection is key. Use sunscreen, avoid tanning, and have moles/lesions evaluated regularly.
- **Sunlight Damage**: Regularly apply broad-spectrum SPF, wear hats/sunglasses, and use antioxidants in skincare.
- **Tinea (Ringworm)**: Use antifungal creams, avoid sharing personal items, and keep skin dry.
- **Unknown/Normal**: If unsure, observe and seek professional dermatological advice for peace of mind.
- **Vascular Tumors**: Most are harmless. Monitor for changes or growth. See a dermatologist if concerned.
- **Vasculitis**: Can signal systemic illness. Seek urgent care. Avoid self-treatment.
- **Vitiligo**: Use sunscreen to protect depigmented areas. Cosmetic treatments and therapy may help.
- **Warts**: Use salicylic acid-based treatments. Avoid picking to prevent spreading.
